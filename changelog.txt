# CHANGELOG

Who did what:
IgorTheLight (current main maintainer) - 1.0.0.0 - 1.0.0.3, 1.0.1.0, 1.0.1.1, 1.1.0.0

## Version 1.1.0.0

- Added: an Experimental section with new (and old) features!
- Added: an ability to start a game in Exclusive Fullscreen from Experimentsl
- Re-added: the ability to start any of the expansions from Experimental
- Fixed: an ability to create and delete profiles. It became broken after few last DE patches.
- Moved: -noprecache and Mod Merger to Experimental
- Retargeted: Modlist to autoupdaes from the "main" branch instead of "DE". What it does is that I could have just one place top update the Modlist
- Removed: isFileBlocked() method because it is never used anymore
- Code refactoring

## Version 1.0.1.1

- Added: a blocking mechanism that is preventing users to set his/her Soulstorm directory to Definitive Edition's directory (from UI and from config file)
- Fixed: a bug where Mod Manager couldn't find dependencies in DE directory
- Removed: an ability to start Definitive Edition with Original, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade or Soulstorm "mods". Now it only starts as developers are intended to. And that...
- Fixed: a bug with expansion "mods" duplication

## Version 1.0.1.0

- Added: autodetection of GOG and Steam versions of Definitive Edition.
- Fixed: detection of mods dependencies if they are not in the DE folder
- Some code refactoring here and there

## Version 1.0.0.3

- Fixed: a mistake where I accidentally posted 1.0.0.2 under "master" branch. Oops! xD
- Fixed: two hidden links that still downloaded from master branch

## Version 1.0.0.2

- Added: additional resiliency  checks when populations list of installed mods
- Changed: INI file name to "DoW DE Mod Manager.ini". Old file will not be used and is not needed anymore! You may safely remove it.
- Changed: JITProfile file name to "DoW DE Mod Manager.JITProfile". Old file will not be used and is not needed anymore! You may safely remove it.
- Changed: filename.Contains("modname") to filename == "modname". Than will "catch" mod names like DXP2Dummy and not show them as playable mods
- Fixed: a bug where ActionState could be written in INI file incorrectly and caused Mod Manager to crash at startup
- Changed: Debug-Release build settings for Release settings. Looks like antiviruses from VirusTotal are not that aggressive against latest builds of Mod Manager
- Some code refactoring here and there

## Version 1.0.0.1

- Fixed: a problem with downloading... anything! Updates, mods, DXVK

## Changelog compared to DoW Mod Manager 2.6.0.3:

- Removed: abilty to add better camera because DE already has a pretty good one
- Removed: abilty to add bigger fonts because DE already has a pretty big ones
- Removed: "-forcehighpoly" and "fullres_teamcolour" because DE has that enabled permanently
- Removed: feature to use only cores 2, 3 and 4 of your CPU. That was some voodoo magic that helped some people previously. Not needed in DE
- Added: support for all new graphical and gameplay features from DE. You can find them in SETTINGS
- Added support for mods that are stored in %AppData%\Relic Entertainment\Dawn of War\Mods
- Added: a warning every time when you are enabling "-noprecachemodels". Yes - it really could cause issues in some cases!
- Added: ability to load mods right from the Soulstorm directory. Just like De does it!
- Temporary disabled: Fog remover because I need to know new memory values for that xD
- Some code refactoring here and there
