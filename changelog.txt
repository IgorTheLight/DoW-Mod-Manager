# CHANGELOG

Who did what:
IgorTheLight (current main maintainer) - 1.0.0.0 - 1.0.0.3

## Version 1.0.0.3

- Fixed: a mistake where I accidentally posted 1.0.0.2 under "master" branch. Oops! xD
- Fixed: two hidden links that still downloaded from master branch

## Version 1.0.0.2

- Added: additional resiliency  checks when populations list of installed mods
- Changed: INI file name to "DoW DE Mod Manager.ini". Old file will not be used and is not needed anymore! You may safely remove it.
- Changed: JITProfile file name to "DoW DE Mod Manager.JITProfile". Old file will not be used and is not needed anymore! You may safely remove it.
- Changed: filename.Contains("modname") to filename == "modname". Than will "catch" mod names like DXP2Dummy and not show them as playable mods
- Fixed: a bug where ActionState could be written in INI file incorrectly and caused Mod Manager to crash at startup
- Changed: Debug-Release build settings for Release settings. Looks like antiviruses from VirusTotal are not that aggressive against latest builds of Mod Manager
- Some code refactoring here and there

## Version 1.0.0.1

- Fixed: a problem with downloading... anything! Updates, mods, DXVK

## Changelog compared to DoW Mod Manager 2.6.0.3:

- Removed: abilty to add better camera because DE already has a pretty good one
- Removed: abilty to add bigger fonts because DE already has a pretty big ones
- Removed: "-forcehighpoly" and "fullres_teamcolour" because DE has that enabled permanently
- Removed: feature to use only cores 2, 3 and 4 of your CPU. That was some voodoo magic that helped some people previously. Not needed in DE
- Added: support for all new graphical and gameplay features from DE. You can find them in SETTINGS
- Added support for mods that are stored in %AppData%\Relic Entertainment\Dawn of War\Mods
- Added: a warning every time when you are enabling "-noprecachemodels". Yes - it really could cause issues in some cases!
- Added: ability to load mods right from the Soulstorm directory. Just like De does it!
- Temporary disabled: Fog remover because I need to know new memory values for that xD
- Some code refactoring here and there
