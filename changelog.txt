# CHANGELOG

Who did what:
IgorTheLight (current main maintainer) - 1.0.0

## Changelog compared to DoW Mod Manager 2.6.0.3:

- Removed: abilty to add better camera because DE already has a pretty good one
- Removed: abilty to add bigger fonts because DE already has a pretty big ones
- Removed: "-forcehighpoly" and "fullres_teamcolour" because DE has that enabled permanently
- Removed: feature to use only cores 2, 3 and 4 of your CPU. That was some voodoo magic that helped some people previously. Not needed in DE
- Added: support for all new graphical and gameplay features from DE. You can find them in SETTINGS
- Added support for mods that are stored in %AppData%\Relic Entertainment\Dawn of War\Mods
- Added: a warning every time when you are enabling "-noprecachemodels". Yes - it really could cause issues in some cases!
- Added: ability to load mods right from the Soulstorm directory. Just like De does it!
- Temporary disabled: Fog remover because I need to know new memory values for that xD
- Some code refactoring here and there
