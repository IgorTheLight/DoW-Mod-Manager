## Version 2.5.0.0

- Added: DXVK support. Now users could install, update and remiove the latest working version of DXVK just by clicking one button!
- Fixed: ThemedDialogBox didn't resize properly so modlist and application changelogs were cropped on the right side
- Refactored: static class DownloadHelper was refactored for less code duplication
