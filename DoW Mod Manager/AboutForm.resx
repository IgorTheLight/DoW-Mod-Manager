    <value>## Version 2.4.1.0

- Added new startup parameter: "-noprecachemodels". It's improves performance but team colors will not be visable on models anymore (because they couldn't be precached, duh! xD)

- Some code refactorings

- Renamed a few variables here and there

- Some small code improvements

## Version 2.2.2.0

- Fixed a crash when there is no line 15 in spdx9_config.txt file in Drivers folder (thanks,  SergeantDiggs)
- WriteSettings() method in SettingManagerForm is more efficient now -allowhwcursor it uses StreamWriter instead of StringBuilder( + File.WriteAllLines())
    
## Version 2.2.0

- Added ability to download mods using MiniBrowser - an Internet Explorer 11 engine wrapped in a WebBrowser object in .NET Framework
- Fixed a bug where instead of a patch,  ModMownloaderForm would still download the mod itself
- Fixed a bug where you click on a non-existent item in RequiredMods Mods when you have no mods installed
- Version checking is more reliable now (version number could be &amp;gt; 9 now,  for example 2.1.10)
- State Machine is simplified now: "ngen install" will be performed every start if "AOTCompilation" setting is selected (it's much more simpler and reliable that way)
- ModManagerForm will write all Settings to a file more efficient when closing
- Renamed a few variables
    
## Version 2.1.9

- Fixed Mod Merger busting some Mods when attempting to merge, such as Unification.
- Fixed disabled Mods not to appear as missing mods in the required mods list, preventing the start of the game, eventhough they would be ignored by the game anyways.
- Removed W40k and DXP2 base game modules from eligible mergeable/starteable mods, since they should never be messed with anyways.
- Fixed the tooltip for the ''No Fog'' disable checkbox, that didn't appear when it was supposed to.
- Added new warning label to the Mod Merger to warn users of potential causes of crashes when used inappropriately.
- Added support for mods, that are not installed but declared as a deactivated mod in a .module file to be displayed and handled in the mod merger.
- Using a slightly brighter green tone for green text passages.
- Mod Merger inactive mods are now highlighted in an orange tone, missing mods are now shown in red.

- Added a new button to the Mod Merger to easily remove a merge from the system and revert to the original file.
- Fixed a crash with the Mod Manager when deleting multiple .module files at once.
- The Mod Merger now reacts to files being deleted/added manually from the system by the user.

- Added a new checkbox in the Settings-&amp;gt;Video tab to allow the user to easily set the usage of the DirectX 8 cursor (aka. -allowhwcursor). Setting this to zero can help with flickering cursor issues.
- Added a new tooltip to explain what this option does.
- Rearranged several UI elements in the main Mod Manager form into panels to allow for better scaling of the buttons etc.
- Refactored code a little bit so it's more human-friendly (by IgorTheLight)

## Version 2.1.5

- Added a safeguard to disable the ''Disable Fog'' checkbox when using the DoW Mod Manager not in Dawn of War: Soulstorm. Disable Fog only works properly in Dawn of War: Soulstorm.
